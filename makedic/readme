Kangoroo -- perl scripts for generating the dictionaries, in particular merging "DEdict" from Edict and Wadoku

January 2007, Jan Poland

WARNING: this document contains mainly some notes for my own reference, if you want to use the perl scripts, don't
expect any documentation here!

I started with the following ingredients:

1. actual version of EDict from Jim Breen's web site
1a. converted to utf8 removed the first comment line manually and called this edict0.utf8

2. actual version (SQL dump) of Wadoku from Ulrich Apel's site
2a. exported this to wadoku0.utf8 by building a MySql database and using the script "export.sh"

   Try e.g. the following commands and others:

   mysql -u root wadoku
   describe entries;

   Attention: after the sql export, the resulting outpuf file contains some MAC EOL's !! Remove them e.g. with emacs.
   (Maybe this is also possible with sed.)

3. actual version of Kanjidic from Jim Breen's site, saved as kanjidic.utf8 (converted to utf8)

4. a word frequency file wordfreq/wordfreq_ck.utf8, obtained from wordfreq_ck on Jim Breen's site

Put all these in the current directory.
THEN, JUST RUN THE SCRIPT proc.sh 

Enjoy!
