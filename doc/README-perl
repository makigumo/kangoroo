------------

NOTE: This Kangoroo version is written in Perl and DIFFERENT from the QT version.
It is a web-based interface, to be installed on a (local) web server. It is
probably not going to be maintained very much in the future.

The main features are the same as those of Kangoroo (QT), but some details are
missing (e.g. train function).

This Kangoroo-Perl is provided only for "emergency", please use the QT version 
if you can. However, if Kangoroo-QT does not run on your system (e.g. old Windows
version), maybe you can use Kangoroo-Perl.

------------

Installing Kangoroo Perl

Kangoroo Perl is a web-based software written in perl that runs on a web server
(any operating system) and is accessed by a web browser (any operating system).

* install perl and a web server such as Apache
* make sure that the web server can execute perl cgi scripts
* make sure that the web server correctly delivers UTF-8 pages, e.g. for Apache2
  with Linux you have to make sure that the /etc/apache2/file mod_mime-defaults.conf
  contains the line "AddDefaultCharset Off" rather than "AddDefaultCharset ISO-8859-1"
* obtain a Kangoroo resource package (kangoroo_0.5_edict.zip or kangoroo__0.5_dedict.zip)
  and the Kangoroo-Perl software kangoroo-perl_0.5.zip
* unpack Kangoroo-Perl and the resources to one directory of your choice, all files are 
  written to a subdirectory kangoroo (make sure that especially dic.utf8 and kdic.utf8 are 
  contained in this directory)
* chdir to that directory and split the indexes by executing "./splitidx"
* after splitting the indexes, you may remove all .idx, .meta and .nfo files (unless you
  also want to use Kangoroo-QT)
* place kangoroo.pl and kangmain.pl in the cgi-bin directory of your web server
* edit kangoroo.pl, making sure in particular that the $prefix points to the resource
  directory (see the documentation in kangoroo.pl)
* make sure that the www user has write access to the resource directory  

NOTE: The scripts for splitting the indexes have been tested under Linux. Maybe they also run under 
Windows. You may want to create a batch file splitidx.bat . 


------------

Using Kangoroo Perl

* start the web server
* start a web brower and open the url cgi-bin/kangoroo.pl (or whereever you have installed the script)

Note: In contrast to the scripts for splitting the indexes, the main Kangoroo-Perl scripts HAVE
been successfully tested under Windows.

Remark: The learn files of Kangoroo (QT) and Kangoroo-Perl are compatible in principle,
however they use a different sorting.
